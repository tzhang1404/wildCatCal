# CatCal
This is a prototype of a calendar-sharing web-app designed for Northwestern students. Students will be able to manually input their calendar events and set the status of privacy of these events-they can either be public (people viewing will be able to see the content of each event) or private (people will see the events titled as "busy"). Then other students will be able to search for a particular person's calendar by searching thier ID or email. This way, students will be see when their friends are busy and plan their hangouts more efficiently. 

## Getting Started
This web app is currently still in development. The front-end is mostly complete, with a working mechanism for creating events on the website. Now I am working on the back-end development, using database to allow users to store their events in their accounts. Ultimately, this app will utilize the Northwestern Ceasar API in order to allow students to quickly add their classes as events.
